## Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures 
### ITI0204

#### Brief description of the course
Classical data structures: 
- queues, 
- graphs, 
- search trees, 
- hash tables, 
- heaps, 
- their implementation and use in the algorithms. 

Sorting, data, graph, and text search algorithms. 

Algorithm design paradigms: greedy, divide and conquer, branch and bound, dynamic programming, meta-heuristics. 

Introduction to the complexity theory, asymptotic complexity, O-notation, class NP, different methods of complexity analysis. 

Practice of the course includes programming a solution to different tasks. A programming skill and understanding of the basic data types is assumed. 

#### Course assignments
- weekly smaller assignments on main topics
- binary trees implementation homework in package HW01
- HW2
